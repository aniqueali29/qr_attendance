# Enhanced Scanner Implementation - Complete

## Overview
The scan.php page has been completely redesigned with professional features including real-time student preview, audio/visual feedback, dedicated scanner hardware support, and comprehensive diagnostics.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. API Enhancements ✅

### 2. Sound Assets ✅
**Directory: `public/admin/assets/sounds/`**

Directory created with `.gitkeep` file. 
**Action Required**: Add actual sound files:
- `success.mp3` - Pleasant chime for check-in
