## Required Files:

1. **success.mp3** - Pleasant chime for successful check-in
   - Duration: ~0.5-1 second
   - Size: <50KB
   - Suggested tone: Positive, uplifting (C major chord or ascending notes)

2. **checkout.mp3** - Different tone for successful check-out
   - Duration: ~0.5-1 second  
   - Size: <50KB
   - Suggested tone: Completion sound (descending notes or resolved chord)

3. **error.mp3** - Alert sound for validation errors
   - Duration: ~0.3-0.5 second
   - Size: <30KB

4. **warning.mp3** - Neutral beep for duplicate scans
   - Duration: ~0.3-0.5 second

## How to Create/Obtain:

### Option 1: Free Sound Libraries
- **Freesound.org** - Search for "beep", "chime", "notification"
- **Zapsplat.com** - Free sound effects with attribution
- **Mixkit.co** - Free sound effects, no attribution required

### Option 2: Generate with Online Tools
- **BeepBox.co** - Create simple chiptune sounds
- **AudioMass.co** - Online audio editor
- **TwistedWave Online** - Simple tone generator

### Option 3: Use System Sounds
Convert existing system sounds from:
- Windows: `C:\Windows\Media\` (e.g., Windows Ding.wav)
- macOS: `/System/Library/Sounds/`

Convert WAV to MP3 using:
- **CloudConvert.com**
- **Online-Audio-Converter.com**
- **FFmpeg**: `ffmpeg -i input.wav -b:a 64k output.mp3`

## Current Status:
âœ… **Placeholder files created** - Silent MP3 files (234 bytes each) are in place.

These are **silent placeholder files** to prevent 404 errors. The scanner will work, but you won't hear any audio feedback until you replace them with actual sound effects.

## Testing:
After adding files, test by:
1. Opening scan.php
2. Checking browser console for audio loading errors
3. Scanning or manually entering a student ID
4. Verifying sounds play at appropriate times

## File Specifications:
- Format: MP3
- Sample Rate: 44.1kHz or 48kHz
- Bitrate: 64-128 kbps (keep files small)
- Channels: Mono or Stereo
- Volume: Normalized to -6dB to -3dB peak
